Focus:  Stacking totes as high and as fast as possible

How:  by placing a tote (from landfill or human player) under the human player dispense area, a stack of two totes can be 
      easily created
      
      Stacking three totes at a time seems to be the best way to create stacks
      
      A stack of three totes (with can) will take approx. half the time and will yield half the points (36 vs 18) that a stack 
      of six totes will yield. Therefore, if the stacking of three totes and can is faster than half the speed to stack six totes 
      and a can, then stacking stacking of three totes will yield the most points.
      
      Placing the totes so that their longest side is parrallel to the longest side of the HDTP platform is the safest and most 
      effective way to stackt totes
      
      A forklift design is the perferref design for this strategy
      
Positives:  can stack totes extreemely quickly
            
            can score a maximum of 120 points per game (excluding both the "litter" and the recycling cans)
            
            not dependant on the other teams
            
Negatives: large stacks will cause the robot to either break or tip over

            must rely on other teams placing the recycling cans on top of your stacks to score a maximum number of points
            
            Many other teams will adop this strategy and will have (maybe?? but hopefuly not) better robots
            This means that our team has to be within the top eight teams to move on, otherwise the top eight teams will not 
            choose our team (It's all or nothing)

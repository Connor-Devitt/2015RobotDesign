Focus:  transporting totes from the landfill zone to the robots who stack the totes

How:  *no restriction on lentgh or width*
      
      Pick up and transport totes from the landfill zone to other robot to expidite the stacking process and thus score more points
      
      Use a conveyor belt 
      
Positives:  Expidites the stacking process by moving totes

Negatives:  completely relient on teammates
            
            cannot score anypoints alone
            
            pre-game size will be an issue
            
            mobility will be an issue
            
            will get in the way of other robots
